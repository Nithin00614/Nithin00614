## Hi there 👋

I’m a final-year engineering student working towards becoming an **AI Engineer**, with a strong focus on **machine learning, clinical AI systems, and applied generative AI**.

My work centers on building **end-to-end AI systems** that combine predictive modeling, explainability, robustness analysis, and **LLM-based reasoning using domain-specific knowledge (RAG)**. I am currently developing a **clinical decision-support system for chronic kidney disease (CKD)** using official medical guidelines and real-world evaluation practices.

I’m actively strengthening my foundations in:

* Machine Learning & Statistics
* Data Analysis & Model Validation
* Generative AI (RAG, LLM integration)
* System design for AI applications

I aim to build **production-oriented, research-aligned projects** that reflect practical engineering depth rather than isolated experiments.
